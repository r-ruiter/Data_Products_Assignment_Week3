## Introduction

This is week 3 assignment of Coursera's Developing Data Products. 
Goal is a web page presentation with a plot created with Plotly.

## Data and plot

Dataset *LakeHuron* from the package `datasets` is used. This is a timeseries with levels of lake Huron.
```{r libs}
# load required packages and get the data
library(datasets)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
data("LakeHuron")
dfLevel <- LakeHuron %>% tbl_df() %>% transmute(year = time(LakeHuron), level = x)
```

```{r plotting}
lh <- dfLevel %>%
    plot_ly(x = ~year, y = ~level, type = "scatter", mode = "lines") %>%
    layout(title = "Levels of Lake Huron")
lh
```
